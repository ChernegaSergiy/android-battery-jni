# PHP Battery Bridge (Android)

Android application that provides battery data to PHP extensions via IPC.

## Architecture

This implements a "Reverse Socket Bridge" pattern (Termux-style):

1. **PHP creates a local socket server** (127.0.0.1 only)
2. **PHP broadcasts Intent** with the port number
3. **Android BroadcastReceiver** receives the intent, reads battery data, and sends JSON back

## Components

- **MainActivity** - Minimal UI to register the app in launcher
- **BatteryReceiver** - Receives broadcasts and returns battery data via socket

## IPC Protocol

Broadcast Intent: `com.chernegasergiy.battery.GET_STATUS` with extra `remote_port`

Response JSON:
```json
{"l":85,"c":1,"h":1,"t":25,"v":4200,"tech":"Li-ion"}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `l` | Battery level (0-100) |
| `c` | Charging status (1/0) |
| `h` | Health status |
| `t` | Temperature (tenths of degree Celsius) |
| `v` | Voltage (mV) |
| `tech` | Battery technology string |

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Android SDK (ANDROID_HOME)
- Gradle (optional, wrapper included)

### Build APK

```sh
cd android-battery-bridge

# Using Gradle wrapper (recommended)
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Or using system Gradle
gradle assembleDebug
```

APK will be at: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Install on Device
